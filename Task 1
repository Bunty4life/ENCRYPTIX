To build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived, we'll use the data provided in your uploaded file. The Titanic dataset typically includes features such as passenger age, gender, ticket class, fare, and cabin, among others. These features can be used to train a machine learning model to predict survival.

Here's an outline of the process:

Data Exploration and Cleaning:

Load the data.
Explore the data to understand its structure and contents.
Handle missing values and convert categorical data into numerical formats if needed.
Feature Selection and Engineering:

Select relevant features that might influence survival (e.g., age, gender, ticket class).
Create new features if necessary (e.g., family size based on number of siblings/spouses and parents/children aboard).
Model Training:

Split the data into training and test sets.
Train a machine learning model (such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests) using the training set.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score on the test set.
Model Tuning and Improvement:

Optimize the model by tuning hyperparameters or trying different algorithms.
Let's start by extracting and exploring the dataset. I'll begin by unzipping the file and loading the data.
The dataset has been extracted and is named Titanic-Dataset.csv. Let's load and take a look at the first few rows to understand the structure and contents of the data.
import zipfile
import pandas as pd

# Unzip the uploaded file
with zipfile.ZipFile('/mnt/data/archive.zip', 'r') as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall('/mnt/data')

# Load the dataset (assuming a common name like 'train.csv' or 'titanic.csv')
# Since the exact file name is unknown, let's list the files extracted
import os
extracted_files = os.listdir('/mnt/data')
extracted_files
The Titanic dataset contains the following columns:

PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name: Name of the passenger
Sex: Gender of the passenger
Age: Age of the passenger
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Passenger fare
Cabin: Cabin number (if available)
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
Next steps involve data cleaning, feature selection, and model building. If you would like to proceed with any specific analysis or modeling approach, please let me know!
# Load the Titanic dataset
titanic_data = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/Titanic-Dataset.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
titanic_data.head()
